# Round 4: Project Reassessment & Pivot Session
## NETS 2130 Fall 2025 - Final Project Decision Point

**Duration**: 90 minutes

**Purpose**: Use analysis tools to make informed decisions about your final project

**Outcome**: Commit to a viable project with clear execution plan

---

## Overview

You've gone through 3 rounds of ideation. Now it's time to make a **final, informed decision** about what project you'll build.

This session gives you the opportunity to:
1. **Reassess** your current Round 3 project using a viability framework
2. **Reconsider** projects that were dropped (yours or others')
3. **Explore** new project ideas provided by the instructor
4. **Pivot** if your current project has fundamental issues
5. **Commit** to a project you can actually execute in 5 weeks

**Key Principle**: Better to pivot now than to struggle for 5 weeks with an infeasible project.

## New Resources Available

### 📊 Project Viability Rubric
**File**: `reports/RUBRIC-PROJECT-VIABILITY.md`

A 6-dimension scoring system to evaluate any project idea:
- Technical Feasibility (can you build it?)
- Crowdsourcing Viability (will people participate?)
- Incentive Design (do rewards match effort?)
- Scope Appropriateness (right size for 5 weeks?)
- Recruitment Strategy (how will you get users?)
- Quality Control (how will you ensure quality?)

**Score**: /30 total
- 25-30: Strong GO ✅
- 20-24: Weak GO 🟡
- 15-19: Needs Major Revision 🟠
- 10-14: Stop and Pivot 🔴

### 🎯 Steelman Analysis
**File**: `reports/STEELMAN-ANALYSIS.md`

For each Round 3 project, this provides:
- Strengths to build on
- Honest assessment of limitations
- **6-8 concrete pathways** to address limitations
- **3 scope options** (MVP, Standard, Ambitious)
- Week-by-week execution guidance

**Philosophy**: Shows you how your project COULD work, not why it won't.

## Session Structure (90 Minutes)

### Part 1: Self-Assessment (15 minutes)

**Individual Work**

1. **Open the Rubric**: `reports/RUBRIC-PROJECT-VIABILITY.md`

2. **Score Your Current Project**: Rate your Round 3 project on each dimension (1-5)
   - Be honest - this is for your benefit
   - Calculate total score /30

3. **Read Your Steelman Analysis**: Find your project in `reports/STEELMAN-ANALYSIS.md`
   - Note which pathway resonates most
   - Identify your biggest limitation

4. **Ask Yourself**:
   - Is my score ≥20? (If no → strongly consider pivoting)
   - Can I execute the MVP scope in 2 weeks?
   - Do I have a concrete recruitment plan for Week 1?
   - Am I excited to build this?

**Write down**: Your score, biggest concern, and gut feeling (stay or pivot?)

---

### Part 2: Explore Alternatives (20 minutes)

**Individual Work**

You have three types of alternatives:

#### Option A: Revisit Dropped Projects

**Your Own Dropped Projects**:
- Round 1 idea (if you had one)
- Round 2 idea (if it didn't make Round 3)

**Others' Dropped Projects**:
- Browse `round1/` and `round2/` directories
- Look for ideas that scored well but were dropped for wrong reasons
- Consider: Could YOU execute this better with different approach?

**How to Evaluate**:
- Score it using the rubric
- Could you fix its main limitation?
- Do you have advantages the original team didn't? (network, skills, passion)

#### Option B: Improve Your Current Project

**Open Steelman Analysis**: Find your project

**Review the 6-8 Pathways**:
- Which pathway is most feasible for you?
- Which fixes your lowest-scoring rubric dimension?
- Which can you start testing THIS WEEK?

**Review the 3 Scopes**:
- MVP: Can you build this in 2 weeks?
- Standard: Is this your realistic target?
- Ambitious: Only if MVP works

#### Option C: New Ideas from Instructor

See [Instructor's New Project Ideas](#instructors-new-project-ideas) below.

**Evaluation**:
- Score each using the rubric
- Which matches your skills/network?
- Which excites you most?

**Write down**: Top 2-3 alternatives to your current project

---

### Part 3: Small Group Discussion (25 minutes)

**Form groups of 3-4 people**

**Round-robin sharing (15 min)**:
- Each person: 3-4 minutes
  - Current project score
  - Biggest concern
  - Top alternative(s) you're considering
- Others: Ask clarifying questions, note if you'd want to join their alternative

**Group discussion (10 min)**:
- Who should pivot? (Be honest but supportive)
- Who should stay but change approach?
- Any natural team formations emerging around alternatives?
- Common themes across your projects?

**Output**: Each person knows if group thinks they should stay/pivot

---

### Part 4: Decision Time (15 minutes)

**Individual Work**

**Make Your Decision**:

You have 4 options:

1. **STAY with Current Project, Current Approach**
   - Only if score ≥20 AND you're confident
   - Commit to exact scope (MVP/Standard/Ambitious)

2. **STAY with Current Project, Different Pathway**
   - Same core idea, different execution
   - Pick specific pathway from Steelman Analysis
   - Commit to MVP scope first

3. **PIVOT to Different Project** (yours or someone else's)
   - Pick from your alternatives
   - Score it with rubric (must be ≥18 to justify pivot)
   - Commit to MVP scope

4. **JOIN Another Team's Project**
   - Found something more viable in group discussion?
   - Reach out, negotiate, combine forces

**Fill Out Decision Form** (see template below)

## FAQs

**Q: My current project scored 15/30. Should I pivot?**
A: Probably yes, unless you have a clear pathway from Steelman Analysis that fixes your lowest dimension and gets you to 20+.

**Q: I want to pivot but my team doesn't. What do I do?**
A: It's OK to leave your team if you believe their project is infeasible. Better now than Week 3. Be respectful but honest.

**Q: Can I take someone else's dropped Round 1/2 idea?**
A: YES! If you can execute it better (better network, different approach, more realistic scope), go for it. Cite original author.

**Q: The instructor's new ideas seem simpler than our Round 3 projects. Is that OK?**
A: YES! Simple but working > complex but broken. The goal is to prove crowdsourcing concepts, not build a startup.

**Q: What if I score my project 18/30 (borderline)?**
A: Read Steelman Analysis pathways carefully. If ONE pathway clearly fixes your issues and you can execute Week 1, stay. Otherwise, pivot.

**Q: Can I combine ideas from multiple projects?**
A: Be careful. Combining usually adds scope/complexity. Better to pick one core idea and execute it well.

**Q: What if I can't find a team?**
A: That's OK for today. You can work solo or find collaborators later. Priority is picking a viable project.

**Q: What happens after today?**
A: You'll submit your commitment form. Next week, you START BUILDING. Week 1 is validation testing (recruitment, partnerships). Week 2-5 is execution.

## Key Takeaways

### Do's ✅
- **Be honest** with yourself about viability scores
- **Choose simplicity** if unsure (MVP scope)
- **Test assumptions Week 1** (recruitment, partnerships)
- **Pick projects you're excited about** (you'll be more motivated)
- **Read the Steelman Analysis** thoroughly (it has solutions)

### Don'ts ❌
- **Don't stick with infeasible projects** out of stubbornness
- **Don't try to build everything** (pick MVP scope)
- **Don't assume recruitment will work** (test Week 1!)
- **Don't pick projects just because they sound impressive** (pick what you can execute)
- **Don't ignore the rubric** (it exists to help you succeed)

---

## Timeline from Here

**Today**: Make decision, form teams, commit to project
**Week 1**: Validate assumptions (recruitment test, partnership meetings)
**Week 2-3**: Build MVP scope
**Week 4**: User testing, iteration
**Week 5**: Polish, demo prep

**Remember**: The best projects are those that WORK and have REAL USERS, even if simple. An elegant but empty platform will not earn a good grade.

---

**Good luck! Make the decision that will let you succeed.** 🚀
