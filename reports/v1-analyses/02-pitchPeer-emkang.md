# PitchPeer - Adversarial Analysis (V1)

**Authors**: Emily Kang (emkang), Manasi Gajjalapurna (mgajjala)

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Peer feedback platform for startup ideas with gamification and AI quality control. Solid concept but extremely ambitious scope for 4-5 weeks with critical dependencies on network effects and recruiting substantial user base. Risk: building technically impressive but empty platform.

## VERDICT: WEAK GO / NEEDS MAJOR REVISION

**Main Issue**: Catastrophic scope problem - 8-10 complex features (AI quality assessment, video processing, matching algorithm, analytics dashboard) that would challenge professional team with 6 months.

**Critical Flaws**:
- Two-sided marketplace cold-start problem ignored
- AI quality control is vaporware (no implementation details)
- Budget fiction ($250 but also "organic participation")
- Gamification without meaningful value
- Untested motivation model

**Rating**: C+ crowdsourcing, D+ technical feasibility

**Most Critical Change**: Drastically reduce scope and solve cold-start FIRST. Cut video, matching algorithm, analytics. Focus on text pitches + voting with 30-50 pre-recruited users.

**Predicted Outcome**: Build core features weeks 1-3, realize no users week 4, get 10-15 people (classmates), generate 30-40 feedbacks. Demo shows functional system with limited validation. Grade: B/B+ for technical merit.
