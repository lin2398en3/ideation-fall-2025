## By Category

### STOP AND PIVOT (11-14/30)
- FoundryMatch (11) - Startup platform fantasy
- Kinnect (13) - Mobile + APIs, saturated market
- TerraTruth (14) - GIS complexity, wrong project type
- CrowdScout (14) - Video platform + ML impossible

### NEEDS MAJOR REVISION (15-17/30)
- Soundscape (15) - Web + mobile + ML overscope
- PriceScope (16) - Weak incentives
- Auralynx (17) - Audio ML complexity
- PennPulse (17) - Two-sided marketplace

### BORDERLINE (18-19/30)
- GatherAI (18) - Excellent idea, impossible iMessage API
- TrashTag Tracker (19) - Could have worked with validation

---

## Hidden Gems (Could Have Worked with Pivots)

### HIGH Potential 🟢
1. **GatherAI** - Great concept, just needed Slack/Discord instead of iMessage
2. **Soundscape** - Strong planning, needed Penn-only web MVP (80% descope)
3. **CrowdScout** - Good problem, avoid video hosting (use links)

### MODERATE 🟡
4. **TrashTag Tracker** - Best structure, needed Penn focus + validation
5. **Auralynx** - Novel insight, pivot from audio to text/photos
6. **PriceScope** - Right tech scope, needed better incentives

### LOW 🔴
7. **PennPulse** - Crowded space
8. **TerraTruth** - Wrong project type
9. **FoundryMatch** - 90% redesign needed
10. **Kinnect** - Saturated market, no value prop

## Fatal Flaws by Frequency

| Flaw | Frequency | Projects |
|------|-----------|----------|
| **Vague recruitment** | 10/10 (100%) | ALL - no specific channels named |
| **Overscoped** | 8/10 (80%) | All except TrashTag, PriceScope |
| **Weak incentives** | 8/10 (80%) | All except GatherAI, CrowdScout |
| **Technical overambition** | 7/10 (70%) | Mobile, video, ML, GIS, audio |
| **Two-sided marketplace** | 6/10 (60%) | FoundryMatch, CrowdScout, Auralynx, PennPulse, Kinnect, TerraTruth |
| **Critical tech dependency** | 4/10 (40%) | GatherAI (iMessage), CrowdScout (video), TerraTruth (NGO), Soundscape (mobile) |

## Dimension Averages (All 10 Projects)

| Dimension | Avg Score | Status |
|-----------|-----------|--------|
| Quality Control | 3.6/5 | 😊 Best (only >3) |
| Incentive Design | 2.6/5 | 😐 Weak |
| Technical Feasibility | 2.4/5 | 😟 Very Weak |
| Crowdsourcing Viability | 2.4/5 | 😟 Very Weak |
| Scope Appropriateness | 2.3/5 | 😞 Worst |
| Recruitment Strategy | 2.0/5 | 😞 Tied for Worst |

**Key Insight:** Teams understood **quality control** but failed on **scope management** and **recruitment planning**.

## Top Lessons

### What Killed Projects
1. No concrete recruitment plan (100%)
2. Massive overscope - 6-8 features instead of 3-4 (80%)
3. Unvalidated incentive assumptions (80%)
4. Technical red flags: mobile, ML, video, GIS (70%)
5. Two-sided marketplace cold-start (60%)

### What Would Save Them
1. Penn-only hyperlocal focus
2. 50-70% feature cuts
3. Week 1 validation before building
4. Named recruitment channels
5. Avoid rubric red flags
6. Manual MVP first
