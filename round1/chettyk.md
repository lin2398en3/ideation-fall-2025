# Crowdsourcing Project Idea: Dream Decider

## Problem Statement
Like this morning and many others, myslef and others often wake up from unique dreams unsure of their meaning on our life. From the studies I've read,  dream interpretation is subjective and unstandardized. My project is targeted to create a collective dream system where a global crowd collaboratively decodes/crowdsources and categorizes different dreams to help others uncover emotional, cultural, and symbolic patterns.

## Core Concept
**One-line pitch:** Its basically a  global crowdsourcing platform where people can submit their recent dreams and the crowd collaboratively responds to them using collective pattern recognition.

**Target users:** I think the benefittersw ill be people who might be curious about the meaning of their dreams, psychology enthusiasts,and maybe even sleep researchers.

**The crowd:** I'd guess they'd be sort of online ocmmunity users like reddit users, discord communities, or maybe volunteers from online dream communities

**The task:** Crowd workers would read anonymous dream narratives and tag recurring symbols, classify emotions of the dream, and then finally offer a meaning/symbolic/cultural understanding of the dream.

## Key Features
1. Symbol tagging feature, so a simple click-based tagging for different dream elements to simplify characertization of a dream
2. group-based emotional labeling, where workers collectively decide pertinent dream emotions by voting  
3. Dream assignment pool, where the most upvoted community interpretation becomes the dreams meaning for now

## Feasibility Check
**Data source:** dream submissions collected anonymously from Google Forms, or reddit dream communities

**Budget reality:** This can definitely be  donw ith less than $500 using volunteer crowds and communities

**Crowd size needed:** Probably 1000

**Quality control approach:** I'd say agreement weighting, where interpretations by high-consensus users are weighted more in a snese

## Technical Approach
**Human tasks:** Reading dreams, tagging symbols, and making interpretations

**Automated tasks:** cleaning text, keyword/most common word extraction, sentiment analysis possibly

**Aggregation method:** We would do a weighted voting system that merges tags and selects our top-rated interpretation

## Prior Work
**Similar projects:** The first one I reaesrched was DreamBank, whcih is psychology database of dream reports, but no crowdsourcing like my project. The second is a subreddit which is Reddit r/DreamInterpretatio, but unlike my project they only have manual interpretations.

**Lessons from past course projects:** I learned form past projects that the ones with personal, emotional input often attract enthusiastic voluntary crowds

## Why This Could Work
I think this could work because dream interpretation  lends itself to collective meaning-making and subjective talk. The emotional and cultural diversity of a crowd enhances interpretation richness. Personally, I think its low-cost, human-based, and vey unique making it memorable and as such feasible within course constraints.
