# Crowdsourcing Project Idea: Safe Penn

## Author

## Problem Statement
This application will gather crowdsourced data to show real-time reports on 
on-campus crimes and violnece. User can either submit a report or view recent/historical safety data, in order to stay informed and safe on campus.

## Core Concept
**One-line pitch:** A crowdsourced, campus safety application allowing users to submit crime/violine reports or see recent/historical safety data.

**Target users:** People in the Penn community

**The crowd:** People in the Penn community

**The task:** Crowd workers will either submit a crime/violence report
with details like location, or visualize on a map interface real-time safety data or historical safety data

## Key Features
1. Create a report
2. Visualize real-time safety data  
3. Visualize historical data

## Feasibility Check
**Data source:** For the reports, the crowd. For the actual map interface, probably some external map API

**Budget reality:** If we get a lot of users accessing this simultaneously, the server cost might get more expensive, but as an MVP, should not be a big concern

**Crowd size needed:** To produce meaningful data, especially for visualizing historical data, we might need lots of data source (probabaly around 100s)

**Quality control approach:** To make sure people do not post false reports, we can have a small disclaimer like "reports are submitted by users and therefore not verified, so please submit accurate reports"

## Technical Approach
**Human tasks:** Submitting reports and taking actions based on what they see on the map

**Automated tasks:** Storing reports in a database, updating real-time on new reports, etc.

**Aggregation method:** On a map interface - for historical data, heat map might be useful.

## Prior Work
**Similar projects:** Citizen: but this is for all over the country, not specific to Penn

**Lessons from past course projects:** There should be a good incentive for people to provide accurate reports

## Why This Could Work
Reports of crime/violence seem to have gone up recently. Since people care a lot about their safety, I think this app would be a great solution.
