## Problem Statement

At Penn, many students feel intense pressure to seem like they have everything together. The culture of "Penn Face" leads people to hide their stress or exhaustion behind a polished image, creating the illusion that everyone else is doing fine. This often leaves students feeling isolated and disconnected. MoodMap@Penn helps reveal the real emotional climate of campus by letting students anonymously share their moods, showing that no one is alone in how they feel.

## Core Concept

**One-line pitch:** MoodMap@Penn crowdsources real-time mood check-ins from students to visualize the emotional atmosphere across campus.

**Target users:** Penn students, wellness staff, and peer support groups.

**The crowd:** Penn students who submit short, anonymous mood updates.

**The task:** Students log their current mood (happy, stressed, calm, anxious) from a predetermined selection with the option to add a short anonymous noteand tag their campus location such as Van Pelt, Huntsman, or DRL.

## Key Features

1. Campus Mood Heatmap showing which areas feel calm, stressed, or positive.
2. Daily Push Notification reminders to update mood, Daily Mood Streaks, and Reflection Badges to encourage consistent check-ins.  
3. Anonymous Peer Comparison so students can see how others feel and find solidarity.

## Feasibility Check

**Data source:** Student-submitted mood entries through a simple web or mobile app.

**Budget reality:** The main cost is storage and hosting, we are hoping that the workers have non-monetary incentives to participate. <$500 storage is possible for the crowd size.

**Crowd size needed:** 100s of workers.

**Quality control approach:** Penn email login to verify users and rate limits to prevent spam.

## Technical Approach

**Human tasks:** Students self-report their mood and add short optional notes.

**Automated tasks:** Grouping reports by location, updating the map, tracking streaks, and removing outdated entries.

**Aggregation method:** Average mood scores by location and time, with older data weighted less.

## Prior Work

**Similar projects:**

1. Mappiness (LSE) collected large-scale mood data but did not focus on community context.

2. SafePaths Crowd (Fall 2024) mapped safety perception rather than emotions.

**Lessons from past course projects:** Projects that used gamified features and showed visible community results kept users engaged. Apps without clear feedback loops lost participation quickly.

## Why This Could Work

MoodMap@Penn directly addresses the issue of Penn Face by making emotional patterns visible in a safe, anonymous way. Students want to feel understood and connected, and seeing shared experiences can reduce the sense of isolation. With simple check-ins, positive reinforcement, and a clear community purpose, the project is achievable within the course limits and could have lasting impact on student wellness.
